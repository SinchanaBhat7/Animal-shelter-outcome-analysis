# Animal Shelter Outcome Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes animal shelter outcome data to understand factors that influence the outcomes of animals, such as adoption, transfer, or other outcomes.

The project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and basic predictive modeling using Python.
